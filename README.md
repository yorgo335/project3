This project is basically the port from my project 1 that used html, css and JS to React, Redux and Tailwindcss.

For the build tool I used Vite.

React Router was used for routing in this project, therefore allowing us to have a single page application. In other words everything is being ran on 1 page.

Redux was used to hold the infos on all products allowing me to not need to refetch them every time I needed a product's info.

Tailwindcss was used for the design of the project.

All products information and images were taken from amazon.com

This project is based on E-commerce site where you can browse products (only 15 products) and check their informations and place orders

Now placing orders doesn't exactly do anything aside from showing a popup mentioning that you placed an order

I have done tests to make this work on both PCs and mobile phones (I mainly used an iPhone 16)
